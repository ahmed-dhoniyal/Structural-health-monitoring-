# 🏚️ AI-Based Building Crack Detection Using Pictures

This project focuses on detecting structural cracks in buildings using AI-powered image analysis. By processing images of building surfaces with computer vision and deep learning models, the system identifies cracks and classifies their severity. This helps in early maintenance planning, improving safety, and reducing repair costs.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Crack detection using deep learning (CNN, YOLO, or similar)
- 📸 Input through static images or camera snapshots
- 🔍 Differentiates between crack types and severity
- 📊 Generates reports and visual overlays for easy interpretation
- ⚙️ Scalable to drone imagery and real-time inspection systems

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch / YOLO (for crack detection models)  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- Flask (optional: for web interface or API)  
- Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano (optional: for on-site/edge inference)

## 📷 How It Works

1. **Capture Image**: Input is taken from a camera or uploaded image of a building wall or structure.  
2. **Preprocess Image**: Enhance and filter the image to improve detection accuracy.  
3. **Detect Cracks**: AI model identifies cracks and marks them.  
4. **Classify Severity**: Based on crack width, length, and pattern, classify as minor, moderate, or severe.  
5. **Generate Output**: Annotated image with crack areas and severity report.  
6. **Optional Real-Time Deployment**: Run detection on portable devices for field use.
